## Features

### Netplay (LAN)
Local network multiplayer with shared screen and synchronized inputs. Both devices display the same game state—think of it as playing on the same console, but over WiFi or hotspot.

- Supports 2 players (host + client)
- Connect via WiFi (same network) or hotspot (auto-generated by host)
- **Not** internet-based multiplayer—LAN only

### GBA Link
True multiplayer for Game Boy Advance games using wireless adapter emulation. Each player has their own independent screen and game state.

- Supports 2 players (tested)
- Automatic hotspot session creation
- Works with games that support the [GBA Wireless Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Wireless_Adapter)
