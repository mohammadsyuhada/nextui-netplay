## Features

### Netplay (LAN)
Local network multiplayer with shared screen and synchronized inputs. Both devices display the same game state—think of it as playing on the same console, but over WiFi or hotspot.

- Supports 2 players (host + client)
- Connect via WiFi (same network) or hotspot (auto-generated by host)
- **Not** internet-based multiplayer—LAN only

### GBA/GBC/GB Link
True multiplayer for GameBoy Advance/Game Boy Color/Game Boy. Each player has their own independent screen and game state.

- Supports 2 players (host + client)
- Connect via WiFi (same network) or hotspot (auto-generated by host)
- Works with GBA games that support the [GBA Wireless Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Wireless_Adapter)
- Works for GBC/GB games that support Game Link.

#### Important Notes for GBA Link

- Place your GBA ROM in the `Game Boy Advance (GBA)` folder
- **Pokémon Game specifics (FireRed/GreenLeaf/Emerald):**
  - **GBA Wireless Adapter mode:** Access to Union Room and Wireless Club Direct Corner
  - **Link Cable - Pokemon Gen3 mode:** Access to Cable Club only (more stable, fewer crashes)
  - The host will have the option to choose mode before start. If client doesnt use the same mode as host, game will be automatically restarted for client to apply the correct mode.

## Developer Note

- Copy and replace all files in the `workspace` folder to the NextUi `workspace` folder. 
- Rebuild `gpsp` and `gambatte` core for all plaform. 
```
# Navigate to the NextUI source code folder
cd NextUi

# Built gambatte core
make build-core PLATFORM=tg5040 CORE=gambatte && make build-core PLATFORM=tg5050 CORE=gambatte

# Built gambatte core
make build-core PLATFORM=tg5040 CORE=gpsp && make build-core PLATFORM=tg5050 CORE=gpsp

# Built NextUI
make all
```
- Final file will be at `build/BASE/MinUI.zip`.
- Use `adb push ./build/BASE/MinUI.zip /mnt/SDCARD && adb shell reboot` to push update to your connected device. 
- Or you can run `make deploy` instead of `make all` to automatically deploy the file to your connected device
